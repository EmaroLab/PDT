# PDT - Pallets Detector and Tracker

## What is PDT?
 
**PDT** is a public repository of codes and *datasets* for detecting and tracking the [pallets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EUR-pallet) in Warehouses based on machine learning approaches using a 2D Laser Rangefinder (LRF). 

The proposed system for pallets detection and tracking is mainly composed of two main components:
1. a Faster Region-based Convolutional Network (Faster R-CNN) detector which is followed by CNN classifier for detecting the pallets.
2. a motion-based Kalman filter for tracking and increasing the confidence of the presence of the pallet.
